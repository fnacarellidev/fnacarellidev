Hi there! I'm Fabio, an ambitious and very curious self-learner, i've been studying at [école 42](https://www.42.fr/) since August of 2022. I've always been in love with everything that it's related to computers, in 2021 I started studying programming by myself until I met 42 and got approved by their selective process.
